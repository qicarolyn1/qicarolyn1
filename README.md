### Hi, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ I am Carolyn, a Business Analyst turned Software Engineer.

After spending the first 4 years of my career as a business analyst focused on quantifying return on Marketing spend, I realized that there has always been a part of me that wanted to be a Software Engineer. Ever since taking Introduction to Computer Science at University of Washington, I have been looking for a transition path, and that is when I found Ada Developers. At Ada, I learned all the full stack basics, from HTML/CSS to backend models. I continued my education as an intern at Rover, using Python and Typescript to improve our landing pages for new customer acquisition. 

Outside of coding, I am a runner, biker, and reader! I also enjoy listening to NPR podcasts and traveling.
